    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Cybereason platform finds a single component of an attack and connects it to other pieces of information to reveal an entire campaign and shut it down.
      There are two types of alerts that Cybereason will create:
      <ul>
        <li>Malops: This stands for a Malicious Operation, and will describe machines, users, processes and connections used in the attack.</li>
        <li>Malware: These alerts are generated when a user tries to run a piece of malware.</li>
      </ul>
